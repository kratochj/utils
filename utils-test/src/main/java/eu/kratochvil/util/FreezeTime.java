/**
 * Once upon a time Mark Needham <ahref="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/09/24/testing-with-joda-time/">wrote</a>
 * about freezing Joda Time. Mark gives all the important details for freezing time (which is often helpful for
 * testing), but I came up with some additional code that I like to add on top of his example.
 * <p/>
 * Two things bother me about Mark's example. First of all, I always like the last line of
 * my test to be the assertion. It's not a law, but it is a guideline I like to follow.
 * Secondly, I don't like having to remember that I need to reset the time back to following
 * the system clock.
 * <p/>
 * I came up with the following idea. It's definitely a poor man's closure, but it does the
 * job for me
 * <p/>
 * Using this code I can keep all assertions as close to the end of the test method as possible,
 * and it's not possible to forget to reset the time back to the system clock.
 * <p/>
 * <code><pre>
 * &#64;Test
 * public void shouldFreezeTime() {
 *    Freeze.timeAt("2008-09-04").thawAfter(new Snippet() {{
 *       assertEquals(new DateTime(2008, 9, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0), new DateTime());
 *    }});
 * }
 * </pre></code>
